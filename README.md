## Hi, I'm Eduardo Titello ðŸ‘‹

I used to be the child who slept with a drilling machine, the self-taught teenager who ~tried to~ created a social network for me and my friends, and now I'm a civil engineer, who is still passionate about the tech world and by knowing how everything arround me works. 

I'm currently sharing my time betwen my engineering PhD, some structural projects, and learning about tech and science. 
I'm also looking for a job position where I can be truly useful with my self-taught hability, ingenious, curiosity, and other skils.
