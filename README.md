## Hi, I'm Eduardo Titello 👋

I used to be the child who slept with a drilling machine, the teenager who ~tried to create~ created a social network for me and my friends, but nowadays I'm a civil engineer, who is still passionate about the tech world and by knowing how everything arround me works. 

Currently I'm sharing my time betwen my engineering PhD🎓, some structural projects🏗️, cooking🍕, and learning about tech💻.
