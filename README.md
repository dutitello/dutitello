## Hi, I'm Eduardo Titello ðŸ‘‹

I used to be the child who slept with a drilling machine, the self-taught teenager who ~tried to~ created a social network for me and my friends. 
Nowadays I work with Operations Research at the Lab Servies of RCI Analytics Intelligence, and research structural reliability on my doctoral thesis.
