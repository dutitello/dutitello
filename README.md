## Hi, I'm Eduardo Titello ðŸ‘‹

I used to be the child who slept with a drilling machine, the self-taught teenager who ~tried to~ created a social network for me and my friends, and now I'm a civil engineer, who is passionate about the tech world and by knowing how everything around me works. 

I'm currently sharing my time between my engineering doctoral, some structural projects, and learning about tech and exact sciences. I'm looking for new challenges in technology, where I believe my true vocation is, and where I can offer much more through my exact science background and my creative personality.
